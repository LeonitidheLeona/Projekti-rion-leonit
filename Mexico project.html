            <h1>A tour guide to Mexico</h1>
            <div><h1>Intro</h1> Ah yes ,Mexico... Where do I start? Great architecture,Comfy beaches,Food that can make a NUKE by itself etc.If you are interested into
                visiting this country then this guide will help you. When you will visit the border for the first time(if by plane then have your passaport) by car you should
                have the registration on your vehicle.The capital of Mexico is Mexico City (how original).A great monument is the Mayan pyramids at Chichén Itzá and Tulum.<img src="Mexico temple.jpeg" id="temple" alt="Welp just google it.">
                Historically,Diego Velázquez, governor of Cuba, laid the foundation for the conquest of Mexico. In 1517 and 1518 Velázquez sent out expeditions headed
                by Francisco Hernández de Córdoba and Juan de Grijalba that explored the coasts of Yucatán and the Gulf of Mexico. Before the conquest of Mexico
                By Cuba, They were ruled by the Aztecs,who build a lot of historical monuments.Here are some really interesting mountains that are worth seeing:<img src="Mexico mountain1.jpeg" id="spain" alt="big mountain" width="300px" height="100px">Pico de Orizaba.The 3rd biggest mountain in North America
                after Denali  of Alaska in USA and Mount Logan in Canada.
    
                <h1>Countries and Economy</h1>Mexico is bordered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States of America</a>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala">Guatemala,</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba">Cuba,</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize">Belize</a>
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras">Honduras</a> by sea. Mexico was also colonized by The Spanish Empire and ruled by it for 3 ceuntries.<img src="MEXICO.png" id="spain" alt="I live in Spain without the S">
                Mexico is quite rich with a high GDP (Gross domestic product a.k.a economy) of 1.2 trillion USD.In comparasion with (let's say) Kosovo that's 120x of Kosovo's economy.Mexico is among the world's largest producers of oil, silver, copper, gold, lead, zinc, natural gas and wood.
                Other minerals, such as mercury, cadmium, antimony, manganese, iron and coal are also found.I don't know much else to say about it so let's move to the spicy stuff.
                <h1>Food</h1>Mexico is literally that one state that can create Nukes but doesn't want to,but I think they know too damn well that nukes would be an overkill.
                They have a lot of spicies and foods that can fulfill your stomach with the only problem being they will destroy the toilet after used once.We've heard of
                Tacos,burritos and enchiladas but also Chiles en nogada,Frijoles Charros (Bean Stew),Mexican Rice,Quesadillas,Huevos Rancheros (Ranch Eggs),Menudo (Tripe Soup),Tamales and Chilli Con Carne (Chilli With Beef).
                As spicy as they sound, they bring to the table twice the fun.
                <h1>Summary</h1>Mexico is a great place for food,national beauty,economy and many more.I'll try to make this web page as fun to read and
                informative for our beloved readers.Other states that I'll make will be more advanced and interactable, and why not make them stylish.
